    <short-summary>
      <p>You will be shown four images: An original image (left), and two reconstructed images (A, B).  <br/>
      Your task is to look at the images carefully and answer the following questions.</p>
    </short-summary>

      <h3>Detailed instruction:</h3>
      <p>
        Compression and reconstruction is a standard workflow in image sharing online (for instance, on WhatsApp). Compressed versions of images are easier to transfer since they occupy less space, but at the loss of quality. When the compressed versions are reconstructed at the receiver's end, we obtain reconstructed images. <br/>
        Images reconstructed from the compressed version of original image are shown. <br/>
        Step 1: Look at the images carefully. Think of which reconstructed image matches well with the original image. <br/>
        Step 2: Answer the following questions based on the images.<br/>
        
      </p>
      
      <positive-example>
      <h3>Good Annotations:</h3>
      <p>A good annotation would involve properly reading the instructions and then carefully answering the questions after putting thought into them.
      To answer the questions, you just have to select the most suitable option among the available options.</p>

    <negative-example>
      <h3>Bad Annotations:</h3>
      <p>A bad annotation would involve not carefully looking at the images. This can lead to improper understanding of the contents in the image which can in turn lead to answering the questions incorrectly. Some of the questions are designed to identify bad annotations so that they can be removed
      from the survey. </p>
